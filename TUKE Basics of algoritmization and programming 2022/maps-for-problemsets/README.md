## What is it?

```
This is the compilation of maps for problemsets. I have not found
these maps on the ZAP site and I want to help students. Please make
note that this repository DOES NOT have solutions for tasks (code).
There's only maps (KW files) to speed up your testing. Please read
the disclaimer above before use. <=== IT IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!

GOOD LUCK AND MARKS! :)
